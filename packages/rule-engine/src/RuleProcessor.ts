/**
 * The RuleProcessor class is responsible for evaluating rules against incoming product events
 * and determining if the conditions and triggers within those rules match the event data.
 * It supports complex rule configurations including conditions, blocks, triggers, and actions.
 * 
 * Methods:
 * - isConditionMatching: Evaluates if a single condition within a rule matches the product event data.
 * - isBlockMatching: Evaluates if a block of conditions matches the product event data based on the block's match type.
 * - isTriggerActorMatch: Determines if the actor of a trigger matches the actor in the product event data.
 * - isTriggerActionMatch: Determines if the action of a trigger matches the action in the product event data.
 * - isTriggerConditionMatching: Evaluates if any trigger within a set of triggers matches the product event data.
 * - isRuleBlocksMatching: Evaluates if the blocks within a rule match the product event data based on the rule's match type.
 * - isRuleMatching: Determines if a rule matches the product event data by evaluating both its triggers and blocks.
 * - isEnabledNonTimerRule: Checks if a rule is enabled and is not a timer-based rule.
 * - getFirstMatchingRule: Iterates through a list of rules and returns the first rule that matches the product event data.
 * 
 * Each method that evaluates conditions, blocks, or rules returns a promise that resolves if the evaluation is successful
 * and rejects if the evaluation fails. This allows for asynchronous processing of conditions and blocks that may require
 * external API calls or other asynchronous operations.
 * 
 * The class relies on a configuration object (ruleConfig) that defines the logic for evaluating conditions, triggers,
 * and actions. This configuration must be provided externally and is expected to match the structure of the rules being evaluated.
